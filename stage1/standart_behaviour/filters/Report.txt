 I used filter - Median. The radius was between 3-5(for each layer). Then I apply layers(0,1,2,3) and as we see still standart behaviour is proper.

 I used filter - Mean. The radius was 7-12. Then applying all layers, as we see  standart behaviour is proper for layer 0,1,2 but for layer_3 it isn't.(When the radius is bigger then 11).

 I used filter - Minimum. The radius was 2,8,13 and higher. As you see in the images the standart behaviour has been violated after applying layer 1(the radius was increased).

 I do not use other filters as their result was the same(smth not clear) and there wasn't any standart_behaviour.
